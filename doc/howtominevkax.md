## How to Mine VKAX

Mining crypto currencies can be an easy way to put your idle technology to work by
earning part of the VKAX block rewards. Using a home computer or even a laptop, anyone
can begin mining!

### STEP 1
Download the VKAX Windows wallet, unzip the folder and run the vkax-qt executable file.
This will open the graphic “QT” wallet and begin the synchronization process. (The first
time can take a while)

You should make an encryption passphrase and backup the wallet.

Navigate to the “Receive” tab and click the “Create new receiving address” button. This is
how you generate a new address, which can be used to receive the VKAX crypto currency.
Next, you will need the software which will be used to mine VKAX with your computer’s
processor.

### STEP 2
Download the Open Source XmrigCC Windows mining software. If your browser warns
about dangerous files, don't worry! This is a false positive. Windows can block crypto
currency related files by default to protect from strangers mining on your computer
without your knowledge. The miners’ code is open source and is not dangerous. Mining
will not harm your computer.

After downloading and extracting the XmrigCC VKAX miner — locate the “mine_VKAX”
batch file. You will need to right click, edit the file and paste your VKAX receiving address
that you generated earlier. Save the file and then double click it, to run it.
If everything worked, the miner should pop up and show you a display. To check the status
of your rigs and payments, you can visit the pools wallet page. Congrats! You are now
mining!
